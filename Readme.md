# ANT+ .Net Library
> A small library to access ANT+ devices with .Net

## Info
This library was created as part of the [OBS ANT+ Hear Rate Monitor](https://github.com/julr/obs-ant-hrm) tool. I decided to split it up into two repositories for easier maintenance.
More details can be found on the linked GitHub project.\
*Note: At the moment only parts of the ANT+ specification are implemented that were needed to address a heart rate sensor. However it should be rather simple to extend if for more use cases*
